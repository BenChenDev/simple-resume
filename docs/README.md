Welcome to the front page of **Simple React Resume**, a free and open-source Resume Builder web app that focuses on one thing, **Privacy**. And also few other important features such as minimalistic UI/UX, customizability, portability, regularly updated templates, etc. But the important thing is that, your personal data is yours alone.

We're going to use this coveted space to discuss about the features of the application, new changes that were introduced since the release and also other information like how to keep the project running through donations and open-source code contribution.
