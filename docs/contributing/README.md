# Contributing

 Your feedback and support is essential for the project to grow in quality and features, so please do reach out to me whenever you have a new feature request, or when you find a bug, and we as a team will get it squashed as soon as possible.

**Here are a few ways you can contribute to the project:**

## Find & Report Bugs

If you run into any trouble while using the app, just let me know by raising an issue on GitHub. The progress of fixing that bug can be tracked from there.

## Request New Features

Something that's missing on the app that's halting your progress from making the best version of your resume? Let us know and we'll try and implement that for you. GitHub's Issue Tracking System is pretty flexible when it comes to things like these, so all you need to do to suggest a new feature is raise an issue on GitHub with the Feature Request template.

## Commit Code

If you are a developer, and a ReactJS developer at that, then you're in demand! Take a look at the code and see how you can make it better. You can setup test cases or extract a particular section of code into a function to improve code reuse. All you need to do is fork the repository on GitHub, make your changes and submit a Pull Request for the same and we'll review it.
